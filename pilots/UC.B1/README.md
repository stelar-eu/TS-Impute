# Use case B1

## Objective

In this use case, we will experiment with different time series imputation 
algorithms on the LAI time series dataset provided by VISTA. 

For each of the algorithms, we first perform hyper-parameter tuning.

In the experiments, we evaluated the following time series imputation 
algorithms:
* Linear Interpolation (Naive)
* SoftImpute
* CDMissingValueRecovery
* Saits
* TimesNet

The metrics measured in our experiments are as follows:
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
* Mean Square Error (MSE). 
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 
* Mean Relative Error (MRE). 
* R-Squared (R2) Score. 
* Execution time (in seconds) for completing the imputation task. 

## Data
The data used in this use case is not publicly available. 

The data is provided by VISTA and is not included in this repository.
